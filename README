  this is a re-run of a previous project [1], 
  but instead of the Atmel AVR 328p a Texas Instruments MSP430F5510 is used

  it is still under development, but the firmware will be able to

   - talk to a number of i2c sensors
   - buffer data into a fram memory chip
   - send data via gprs to an online server
   - use a minimal amount of energy

  there are 3 components in this repository:
  firmware  - contains the C code for the microcontroller
  hardware  - open source hardware for the main board
  server    - server-side implementation of the comm protocol

  * library dependencies for the included avr software:
  none - all is included in the repo

  * compiler toolchain used (gentoo):
        msp430-gcc-4.6.3_p20120406
        msp430mcu-20120716
        msp430-binutils-2.22_p20120911
        msp430-libc-20120716
        mspdebug-0.21

  * development is done using
        MSP430-5510STK [2]
        

  * dependencies for the server-side software:

  sqlite      http://www.sqlite.org/
  gnuplot     http://www.gnuplot.info/


  * sensors used:

  SHT15 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
  Honeywell HSCMRNN030PA2A3 pressure sensor - mouser part: 785-HSCMRNN030PA2A3
